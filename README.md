### Introduction

django-forrest is set of files and configurations to ease the django development
and deploy for users.

Everytime im starting a new project i think i may be missing a best practice or
something that i can improve, so based in some projects like
``django-party-pack`` and ``djangolint``, i tried to build a great starting
point for everyone that wants to have a great enviroment to focus on creating
awesome django apps.

Its is named because of Forrest Gump, as even with his problems you always could
rely on him - and this is the point.

Some decisions are hard, and here is django-forrest to help =)
